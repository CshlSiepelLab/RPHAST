	  parameter boundaries, hold specified boundaries constant.  Some
	  of the default values are now different from command-line phyloFit.
	* added support for alternate lineage-specific models within
	  the tree model object
	* to support lineage-specific models, added support for labels in
	  phylogenetic trees which are denoted by the pound sign ie,
	  "((human #primate, chimp #primate)#primate, mouse)"
	* added plot.rate.matrix (and plot.tm and plot.altmodel.tm)
	* added summary.tree function which returns a data frame with various
	  information about each branch
