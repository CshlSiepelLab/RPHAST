Title: RPHAST: R interface to PHAST
Author: Melissa Hubisz, Katherine Pollard, and Adam Siepel
Maintainer: Melissa Hubisz <mjhubisz@cornell.edu>
Description: RPHAST is an R interface to the PHAST pacakge
    (Phylogenetic Analyis with Space/Time Models).  It can be used for
    many types of analysis in comparative and evolutionary genomics,
    such as estimating models of evolution from sequence data, scoring
    alignments for conservation or acceleration, and predicting
    elements based on conservation or custom phylogenetic hidden
    markov models.  It can also perform many basic operations on multiple
    sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees.
